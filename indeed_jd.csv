We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.
Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.
Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinise and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.
Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.

About Fraser and Neave, Limited
Fraser and Neave, Limited (""F&N"" or the ""Group"") had its origins, more than a century ago, in the spirited decisions of two enterprising young men, John Fraser and David Neave, who diversified from their printing business to pioneer the aerated water business in Southeast Asia in 1883. From a soft drinks base, F&N ventured into the businesses of beer in 1931, dairies in 1959, property development and management in 1990 and publishing & printing in 2000. In 2012, the Group divested a substantial part of its beer business. In 2013, as F&N celebrated its 130th year of operation, it also welcomed its new majority shareholder, the TCC Group, which is engaged in food and beverage, real estate, industrial trading and consumer products, insurance and agriculture. In January 2014, through a distribution in specie and re-listing of Frasers Property Limited by way of introduction on the Singapore stock exchange, the Group demerged its Properties business.
Today, F&N is a leading Asia Pacific Consumer Group with expertise and prominent standing in the Food & Beverage and Publishing & Printing industries. Leveraging its strengths in marketing and distribution, research and development, brands and financial management, as well as years of acquisition experience, the Group provides key resources and sets strategic directions for its subsidiary companies across both industries. Listed on the Singapore stock exchange, F&N ranks as one of the most established and successful companies in the region with an impressive array of renowned brands that enjoy strong market leadership. F&N is present in 11 countries spanning Asia Pacific, Europe and the USA, and employs over 7,700 people worldwide.

Who we are
GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) division uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.
What it is like working here:
We build products that serve a variety of agency users, who use them to solve highly meaningful problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.
Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.
Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.
Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.
Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even programming languages is not just encouraged but essential.
What you will be working on :
Product managers help make sure the right things get done. At a high level, this means establishing a clear vision for what a product should be and what needs to be done to get there. On a day to day basis, this means handling all the different facets of a product and making sure they are coordinated. And at the core, this means building a foundation of knowledge across user needs, technical constraints, and design goals so you can act as a bridge across all of them which includes:
1) Making good product decisions
Working with designers to create intuitive user experiences
Creating multiple proposals for the many forms a product can take
Leading the team to reach a balanced and considered position on what the product should be
Responsible for the product roadmap and key product features
2) Understanding users better than anyone else
Conducting user studies to understand their needs and problems
Analysing data to uncover usage patterns that inform product decisions
Researching the industry to understand existing solutions
3) Work closely with the engineering team
Translating the product strategy into technical, detailed, actionable plans for business and engineering teams
Understanding developersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ needs and exploring emerging tools and techniques that can meet the needs
4) Communicating across teams
Explaining technical considerations to non-technical audiences
Public-speaking, giving presentations and writing papers
Identifying key stakeholders, including government agencies, industry partners and the broader tech community, and convincing them to give their support
Coordinating efforts across multiple functions including marketing, legal and finance
5) Keeping things organised
Running efficient meetings to keep people updated and make good decisions
Prioritising, planning, and tracking what needs to be done
Documenting key information and decisions about the product
Responsible for securing funding, and monitoring expenses
What we are looking for:
The customers for our products are normally agency users, which means that prior public service experience will help. A disciplined approach and strong problem-solving instincts are fundamental to succeed. Your aptitude for completing the tasks and attitude to continuous learning are more valued than any formal certification. We look for product managers who:
Ideally past or current practitioner of agile software development, including experience in some of the relevant areas such as CI/CD, Devops, Microservice, TDD/BDD
Have experience in using data science and machine learning to solve problems
Have experience writing code and working in software development
Possess technical competency and ability to balance technical constraints, design goals and user needs to achieve good delivery outcomes
Have awareness and experience on one or more cloud service offerings
Have excellent analytical, conceptualisation and problem-solving skills
Have good design sense
Have solid communication and stakeholder management skills

Machine learning,Research Assistant/ Associate on Dialogue Summarization (DesCartes - WP5),"Description
Dialogue summarization is the task of synthesizing a conversation between several speakers in order to give better access to discussed key information (e.g. decisions in meetings), or facilitate downstream analysis tasks (crisis management). The field has expanded considerably, with new reference datasets (Samsum, Mediasum), and a growing number of approaches, both extractive and abstractive (see Feng et al. 2022).
A few recent works are trying to have a more global approach by taking into account the structure of conversation: how speakers' acts relate to each other (questions, answers, corrections, ...), and the global context to local utterances (e.g. coreferences, cf Liu & Chen 2021) using dedicated models for the prediction of such structures. As such tools are brittle, and dialogue datasets are very domain-specific, there is also a need to develop approaches less dependent on supervision, cf (Badene et al. 2019, Fu et al. 2021).
This RA position aims to evaluate recent efforts at taking dialogue structure into account for summarization, integrate weak supervision approaches, and help design new developments to improve existing work.
Preferred
Bachelor's/ Master's degree in Computer science with a solid background in NLP and/or machine
learning
A good experience in deep learning approaches for NLP
Good programming skills in Python
